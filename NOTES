Failed attempts:

Removing DRM_MEM_MAPS seems to fail when loading i915kms:
drmn0: <Intel Haswell (ULT GT2 mobile)> on vgapci0
info: [drm] Memory usable by graphics device = 2048M
error: [drm:pid833:i915_driver_load] *ERROR* failed to map registers
device_attach: drmn0 attach returned 5


!!!!! Including linux/slab.h in drmP.h break everything !!!!!
Resolved, PAGE_MASK was to blame
